In the "JS Advanced" module, students will delve deeper into the functionality of the JavaScript language, exploring the environment where it is most commonly used and designed for - the browser. JavaScript will be examined as the fundamental syntax, and participants will acquaint themselves with programming concepts through the lens of the language. What is functional programming, and what are the differences with object-oriented programming? They will study in detail the components of the browser, the DOM tree, and how to add, remove, and edit elements within it. What does unit testing involve, and what are the basic approaches to testing code? By the end of the module, students will have the necessary knowledge to create a Single Page Applications type of application, entirely written in JavaScript, using concepts such as Routing and Templating. They will learn how to use databases as a ready-made service.
